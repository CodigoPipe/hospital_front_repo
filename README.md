Hi guys

if you want to check the visual interface just run with live server the html file

i struggled a lot with the backed so didnt have enough time to finish, i created the interfaces and the async functions
so, still missing some functions, rigth now, you can create specialities and patients with postman sendigg json files with the
info that the dto asks in the back repo, tha way you can use the button get specialities and get patients to get the info in the front
